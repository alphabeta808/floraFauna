                                types of black orchids in Indonesia, namely Kalimantan black orchids and Papuan black orchids. Even though both
                                Named the black orchid, both Kalimantan and Papua black orchids have different shapes. Orchid
                                Kalimantan black has green flowers and black flowers. Whereas
                                Papuan black orchids have dark black flowers with brightly colored pistils.

                                water sources and swamp forests. Sago is famous for its life in the form of clumps, which

                                Bamboo is one of the plants that we often encounter around us and is often found growing 
                                in clumps. This type of plant is also known as a type of grass and has a segmented stem. 
                                Therefore, bamboo belongs to the Poaceae family. Bamboo plants have 70 genera and are 
                                included in one of the plants that have a rapid growth rate. In fact, some types of these 
                                plants can grow up to 60 cm per day.

                                Bonsai (Japanese: 盆栽, lit.'tray planting', pronounced [boɰ̃sai] (listen))[1] is the 
                                Japanese art of growing and training miniature trees in pots, developed from the 
                                traditional Chinese art form of penjing. Unlike penjing, which utilizes traditional 
                                techniques to produce entirely natural scenery in small pots that mimic the grandiose 
                                shapes of real life scenery, the Japanese "bonsai" only attempts to produce small trees 
                                that mimic the shape of real life trees. Similar versions of the art exist in other 
                                cultures, including the miniature living landscapes of Vietnamese Hòn non bộ. It was 
                                during the Tang dynasty, when penjing was at its height, that the art was first introduced
                                in Japan.

                                Laportea is a genus of plants in the family Urticaceae. They are herbaceous, either 
                                annual or perennial. Like many plants of the Urticaceae, they have stinging hairs. There 
                                are stinging and non-stinging hairs on the same plant. The genus was named after the 
                                French naturalist Francis de Laporte de Castelnau.

                                A cactus (PL: cacti, cactuses, or less commonly, cactus)[3] is a member of the plant family
                                Cactaceae,[a] a family comprising about 127 genera with some 1750 known species of the order
                                Caryophyllales.[4] The word cactus derives, through Latin, from the Ancient Greek word κάκτος
                                (káktos), a name originally used by Theophrastus for a spiny plant whose identity is now not 
                                certain.[5] Cacti occur in a wide range of shapes and sizes. Although some species live in 
                                quite humid environments, most cacti live in habitats subject to at least some drought. Many 
                                live in extremely dry environments, even being found in the Atacama Desert, one of the 
                                driest places on Earth. Because of this, cacti show many adaptations to conserve water. 
                                For example, almost all cacti are succulents, meaning they have thickened, fleshy parts 
                                adapted to store water. Unlike many other succulents, the stem is the only part of most 
                                cacti where this vital process takes place. Most species of cacti have lost true leaves, 
                                retaining only spines, which are highly modified leaves. As well as defending against 
                                herbivores, spines help prevent water loss by reducing air flow close to the cactus and 
                                providing some shade.

                                A rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa, in the family Rosaceae,
                                or the flower it bears. There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars.
                                They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are 
                                often armed with sharp prickles.[citation needed] Their flowers vary in size and shape and are 
                                usually large and showy, in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds. Most species are 
                                native to Asia, with smaller numbers native to Europe, North America, and northwestern Africa. 
                                Species, cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant. Roses 
                                have acquired cultural significance in many societies. Rose plants range in size from compact, 
                                miniature roses, to climbers that can reach seven meters in height.[citation needed] Different species 
                                hybridize easily, and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses.

                                The bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) is a bird of prey found in North America. A sea 
                                eagle, it has two known subspecies and forms a species pair with the white-tailed eagle 
                                (Haliaeetus albicilla), which occupies the same niche as the bald eagle in the Palearctic. 
                                Its range includes most of Canada and Alaska, all of the contiguous United States, and 
                                northern Mexico. It is found near large bodies of open water with an abundant food supply 
                                and old-growth trees for nesting.

                                The bald eagle is an opportunistic feeder which subsists mainly on fish, which it swoops 
                                down upon and snatches from the water with its talons. It builds the largest nest of any 
                                North American bird and the largest tree nests ever recorded for any animal species, up to
                                4 m (13 ft) deep, 2.5 m (8.2 ft) wide, and 1 metric ton (1.1 short tons) in weight. Sexual 
                                maturity is attained at the age of four to five years.

                                The Javan rhinoceros (Rhinoceros sondaicus), also known as the Javan rhino, Sunda rhinoceros
                                or lesser one-horned rhinoceros, is a very rare member of the family Rhinocerotidae and one 
                                of five extant rhinoceroses. It belongs to the same genus as the Indian rhinoceros, and has 
                                similar mosaic, armour-like skin, but at 3.1–3.2 m (10–10 ft) in length and 1.4–1.7 m 
                                (4.6–5.6 ft) in height, it is smaller (closer in size to the black rhinoceros of the genus
                                Diceros). Its horn is usually shorter than 25 cm (9.8 in), and is smaller than those of the
                                other rhino species. Only adult bulls have horns; cows lack them altogether.
                                Once the most widespread of Asian rhinoceroses, Javan rhinos ranged from the islands of 
                                Java and Sumatra, throughout Southeast Asia, and into India and China. The species is 
                                critically endangered, with only one known population in the wild, and no individuals in 
                                captivity. It is possibly the rarest large mammal on Earth,[4]: 21  with a population of 
                                approximately 74 in Ujung Kulon National Park at the western tip of Java in Indonesia.[5] 
                                The Javan rhinoceros population in Vietnam's Cat Tien National Park was declared to be 
                                locally extinct in 2011.[6] The decline of Javan rhinos is attributed to poaching, 
                                primarily for their horns, which are highly valued in traditional Chinese  medicine, 
                                fetching as much as US$30,000 per kg on the black market.

                                The polar bear (Ursus maritimus) is a hypercarnivorous bear whose native range lies 
                                largely within the Arctic Circle, encompassing the Arctic Ocean, its surrounding seas and 
                                surrounding land masses. It is the largest extant bear species, as well as the largest 
                                extant land carnivore.[6][7] A boar (adult male) weighs around 350–700 kg (770–1,540 lb),
                                [8] while a sow (adult female) is about half that size. Although it is the sister species 
                                of the brown bear,[9] it has evolved to occupy a narrower ecological niche, with many body 
                                characteristics adapted for cold temperatures, for moving across snow, ice and open water, 
                                and for hunting seals, which make up most of its diet.[10] Although most polar bears are 
                                born on land, they spend most of their time on the sea ice. Their scientific name means 
                                "maritime bear" and derives from this fact. Polar bears hunt their preferred food of seals 
                                from the edge of sea ice, often living off fat reserves when no sea ice is present. Because 
                                of their dependence on the sea ice, polar bears are classified as marine mammals.[11]

                                Kangaroos are indigenous to Australia and New Guinea. The Australian government estimates that 
                                42.8 million kangaroos lived within the commercial harvest areas of Australia in 2019, down from 53.2 
                                million in 2013.[2]

                            <p>
                                The Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis), also known as the Komodo monitor, is a member of 
                                the monitor lizard family Varanidae that is endemic to the Indonesian islands of Komodo, 
                                Rinca, Flores, and Gili Motang. It is the largest extant species of lizard, growing to a 
                                maximum length of 3 metres (10 ft), and weighing up to 70 kilograms (150 lb).
                                As a result of their size, Komodo dragons are apex predators, and dominate the ecosystems 
                                in which they live. Komodo dragons hunt and ambush prey including invertebrates, birds, and 
                                mammals. It has been claimed that they have a venomous bite; there are two glands in the 
                                lower jaw that secrete several toxic proteins. The biological significance of these proteins 
                                is disputed, but the glands have been shown to secrete an anticoagulant. Komodo dragons' group
                                behavior in hunting is exceptional in the reptile world. The diet of Komodo dragons mainly 
                                consists of Javan rusa (Rusa timorensis), though they also eat considerable amounts of carrion.
                                Komodo dragons also occasionally attack humans.

                                The leopard (Panthera pardus) is one of the five extant species in the genus Panthera, a 
                                member of the cat family, Felidae. It occurs in a wide range in sub-Saharan Africa, in 
                                some parts of Western and Central Asia, Southern Russia, and on the Indian subcontinent to 
                                Southeast and East Asia. It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List because leopard 
                                populations are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, and are declining in large 
                                parts of the global range. The leopard is considered locally extinct in Hong Kong, Singapore,
                                South Korea, Jordan, Morocco, Togo, the United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan, Lebanon, Mauritania,
                                Kuwait, Syria, Libya, Tunisia and most likely in North Korea, Gambia, Laos, Lesotho, Tajikistan,
                                Vietnam and Israel. Contemporary records suggest that the leopard occurs in only 25% of its 
                                historical global range.

                            <p>
                                Peafowl is a common name for three bird species in the genera Pavo and Afropavo within the
                                tribe Pavonini of the family Phasianidae, the pheasants and their allies. Male peafowl are 
                                referred to as peacocks, and female peafowl are referred to as peahens, even though peafowl
                                of either sex are often referred to colloquially as "peacocks".
                                The two Asiatic species are the blue or Indian peafowl originally of the Indian subcontinent,
                                and the green peafowl of Southeast Asia; the one African species is the Congo peafowl, native
                                only to the Congo Basin. Male peafowl are known for their piercing calls and their extravagant
                                plumage. The latter is especially prominent in the Asiatic species, which have an eye-spotted 
                                "tail" or "train" of covert feathers, which they display as part of a courtship ritual.

                                The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India.
                                It has a muscular, broad-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft 
                                at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females 
                                and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's 
                                pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions 
                                usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone 
                                predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt 
                                humans, the species typically does not actively seek out and prey on humans.

                                A camel is an even-toed ungulate in the genus Camelus that bears distinctive fatty 
                                deposits known as "humps" on its back. Camels have long been domesticated and, as 
                                livestock, they provide food (milk and meat) and textiles (fiber and felt from hair). 
                                Camels are working animals especially suited to their desert habitat and are a vital means
                                of transport for passengers and cargo. There are three surviving species of camel. The 
                                one-humped dromedary makes up 94% of the world's camel population, and the two-humped 
                                Bactrian camel makes up 6%. The Wild Bactrian camel is a separate species and is now 
                                critically endangered.

                            <p>
                                The orca or killer whale (Orcinus orca) is a toothed whale belonging to the oceanic dolphin
                                family, of which it is the largest member. It is the only extant species in the genus 
                                Orcinus. It is recognizable by its black-and-white patterned body. A cosmopolitan species, 
                                orcas can be found in all of the world's oceans in a variety of marine environments, from 
                                Arctic and Antarctic regions to tropical seas.
                                Orcas have a diverse diet, although individual populations often specialize in particular 
                                types of prey. Some feed exclusively on fish, while others hunt marine mammals such as 
                                seals and other species of dolphin. They have been known to attack baleen whale calves, 
                                and even adult whales. Orcas are apex predators, as they have no natural predators. They 
                                are highly social; some populations are composed of very stable matrilineal family groups 
                                (pods) which are the most stable of any animal species. Their sophisticated hunting 
                                techniques and vocal behaviours, which are often specific to a particular group and passed
                                across generations, have been described as manifestations of animal culture.
